## Thanks!

A big thanks goes to the SlimefunAddonCommunity guinea pig testers and a separate thanks for MCTantrum (B, Decoy and Oddish) who went over and above in their testing.

Another big shoutout to GentlemanCheesy who creates some of the skulls used in the addon, taken from Netheopoiesis.

And lastly, a big thanks goes to https://minecraft-heads.com who kindly gave their permission to utilise heads they've procured within our addon.
